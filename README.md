install dependencies
in Root dir, install jar dependencies by maven

``` $ mvn install ```

Endonces, cd to the frontend dir and install js dependencies by npm.

npm can be replace with cnpm and install cnpm with ``` $ npm install cnpm -g ```

Cnpm is strongly recommended for the terrible network in china.

``` $ cd frontend```

``` $ npm install``` or ``` cnpm install ```

# Run backend

The java backend will start with the log streaming.

# Run frontend

``` $ cd frontend```

``` $ npm run dev``` or ``` cnpm run dev ```
